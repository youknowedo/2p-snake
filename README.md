# 2p-snake - [Play now](https://sprig.hackclub.com/share/3p31YkiZ3lh0zj5CuyRa)

Team up with a friend in this adaptation of the classic Snake. Fight against the increasing speed and struggles in limited space. The game is meant to be played with a friend which is why there's only one score. It's not about one's individual achievements but what the group has accomplished.

W-A-S-D - Move blue snake
I-J-K-L - Move red snake

L - Confirm
